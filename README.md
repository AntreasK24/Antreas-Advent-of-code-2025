# Antreas--Advent-of-code-2025
My attempt to complete the 2025 advent of code.



# What is this ?

Directly from [the advent of code website](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about)

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
"

# Why are you doing this?

Seemed like a fun challenge to sharpen my coding skills. No guarantee that these solutions are the best or fastest, just trying to get better at coding and having some fun along the way.

# Are you imposing any limitations to make your life harder?

Why yes I am. Each I will use a new random programming language, whether I've used it before or not. Additionally I am limiting the use of LLMs to only theoretical/documentation questions.
